# Parking Space Detection

Parking space detection using OpenCV and Python involves capturing images or video of a parking area and processing them with OpenCV. Preprocessing steps like grayscale conversion and contour detection are used to identify potential parking spaces. These spaces can be classified as occupied or vacant, often with background subtraction or machine learning models. Visualization is done by marking spaces on the original image, and depending on the application, alerts can be triggered or data can be recorded.
